    <p>Interview with Chlo√© Kiffer, renowned violinist and music professor in New York</p>
  </header>

  <main class="container">
    <section class="interview">
      <section class="question">
        <h2>What is your musical background?</h2>
        <p>"I started the violin very early, at the age of 5 or 6 with my mother <i>[a violin teacher in Metz, Ed.]</i>, whom you know. Then I went to the <b>Conservatoire de Metz</b>, where there were lots of classes like choir, chamber music, solf√®ge, violin... I continued my studies at the <b>Paris Regional Conservatory Ida Rubinstein</b> for 1 year, where I won awards and did a ‚Äúperfectionnement‚Äù. I then did a 4-year Bachelor's degree at the <b>Paris National Superior Conservatory of Music and Dance</b> and later completed a Master's and a Doctorate in Germany and the United States."</p>
      </section>

      <section class="question">
        <h2>What are the main differences in violin education?</h2>
        <p>"It depends on the teacher. If I had a Russian violin teacher in the U.S., the teaching would be Russian, not American. Personally, I had very ‚ÄòFrench‚Äô teachers in France. [...]</p>
        <p>There are no conservatories in the U.S., unlike in France, where almost every small town has one‚Äîlike Metz or Sarreguemines. In the U.S., <b>music is mostly taught by private teachers</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Students can learn violin without studying theory, while in France, to enter the CNSM, I had to pass not just violin tests but also theory, sight-reading, and more. [...]</b></p>
        <p>In the U.S., <b>music education is very expensive</b>. Scholarships are available for students who can't afford it, and for top-level students.</p>
        <p><b>So music and violin education are more accessible in France than in the U.S."</b></p>
      </section>

      <section class="question">
        <h2>Career: soloist or teacher?</h2>
        <p>"You know, I've never been just a soloist. <b>I've always combined teaching and concerts. Both fulfill me so much.</b> I can‚Äôt imagine living without either."</p>
      </section>

      <section class="question">
        <h2>Which system do you think is better?</h2>
        <p><b>"The system in the U.S. is freer. But both systems work."</b></p>
      </section>

      <section class="question">
        <h2>Are the degrees the same?</h2>
        <p><b>"Now, the degrees are quite the same</b>. There‚Äôs the Bachelor's, the Master's, and the Doctorate‚Äîwhich is rare but recommended. However, there's no CE or DE like in France, which are required to teach in conservatories. <b>No specific degree is required to teach music in the U.S."</b></p>
      </section>

      <section class="question">
        <h2>Did you have any preconceptions about the United States?</h2>
        <p>"No, not really. But it changed me. <b>I found‚Äîand still find‚Äîthat the atmosphere is very positive, much better than in France. Students are encouraging, comments are constructive, and the vibe is super friendly."</b></p>
      </section>

      <section class="question">
        <h2>A word about your teachers?</h2>
        <p>"I‚Äôve had many teachers, including <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinchas_Zukerman'>Pinchas Zukerman</a> <i>[Very famous Israeli violinist, Ed.]</i>, who really helped me with bowing technique and organizing my work. <b>All of my teachers helped me understand how to articulate concepts so students truly understand."</b></p>
